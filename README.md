Bare Metal ARM Development Example
==================================

This is a very basic, no-frills example of a bare metal ARM
development setup. The targeted device is a SAM3X8E on an Arduino Due
board.

The purpose of this project is more or less just to give me a skeleton
to copy when spinning up new projects.

Requirements
============

  - The arm-gcc toolchain
  - A Unix-like environment (Windows is probably OK but you're on your
    own)
  - Patience
